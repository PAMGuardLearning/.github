# PAMGuardLearning
## Introduction
This collection of GitHub repositories contains source material for training tutorials for the [PAMGuard 
software](https://www.pamguard.org) and [https://github.com/PAMGuard/](https://github.com/PAMGuard/).

## PAMGuard Users
If you're a PAMGuard user, then you probably **don't** want to be looking at the material here. You should go 
straight to the tutorial instructions on the PAMGuard website at [https://www.pamguard.org/69_Tutorials.html](https://www.pamguard.org/69_Tutorials.html).
From there, you'll get the latest version of the tutorial instructions and find links to material required to complete the tutorial. This 
may consist of PAMGuard configuration files, sound recordings, and processed PAMGuard data. Some of the files used are already in the public 
domain, or may be too big to host on certain servers, so these links might be to a variety of servers around the world. 

## PAMGuard Trainers
If you're running PAMGuard training courses, then you may want to take the source material from here to include as part of a training 
package, perhaps modifying it and adding to it to suit the needs of your course or organisation. Please check the licenses for 
each repository. Whereever possible, we've given a very permissive license allowing you to do whatever you want with the material. 
Some licenses however may require you to share back any modifications.
